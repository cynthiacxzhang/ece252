**Coffman's Conditions for Deadlock**

1. Mutual Exclusion

- a resource belongs to, at most, one thread at a time

2. Hold and Wait

- a thread holds a resource and waitws (blocks) to aquire others

3. No Preemption

- only the resource-holding thread can release the resource

4. Circular Wait

- a cycle exists in the R.A.G.


These 4 conditions are necessary and sufficient for deadlock to occur
- breaking any of these conditions prevents/avoids deadlock
