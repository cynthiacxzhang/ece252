**Condition Variables**

A condition variable is a synchronization tool used to allow threads to wait for specific conditions or events to occur, typically involving shared resources.

Situation: combine a mutex unlock wiht a wait for events
- can be signalled (like post - wakes 1 blocked thread) or broadcasted (wakes all blocked threads)
- a signal or broadcase is lost if there are no threads blocked (waiting)

    Thread A:
        lock mutex
        while (!condition):
            wait on condition variable, mutex
        do something
        unlock mutex

    Thread B:
        lock mutex
        update state
        if(condition)   // needed by thread A
            signal/broadcast condition variable
        unlock mutex
    
    Note: waiting a condition variable implicitly unlocks the mutex before blocking, and relocks mutex after unblocking

- Thread A needs to recheck the condition after waiting because another thread, C, could have locked the mutex first and changed the condition.
