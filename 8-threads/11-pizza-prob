**Pizza Makers Problem**

E.g. Cigarette Smokers Problem

Scenario: 
- 3 chef threads and 1 food supplier thread
- chefs loop forever waiting for 3 ingredients, and making pizzas
- ingredients: dough, sauce, cheese
- each chef has an unlimited supply of 1 ingredient
- each time the supplier is signalled it supplies two different random ingredients
- the supplier should only be signalled if no chef can proceed

E.g. whenever a chef sees on the table the two ingredients they don't have, they take those, make a pizza, and signal the supplier again

Setup: 

    semaphores -> supply = 1, dough = 0, sauce = 0, cheese = 0
    
        // these control when ingredients are placed and when the supplier can act

        supply (1) - limits supplier's supply actions
        dough (0) - synchronizes dough supplies
        sauce (0) - synchronizes sauce supplies
        cheese (0) - synchronizes cheese supplies

Thread Behavior! 

## Supplier Threads:

        loop:
        1. wait on supply semaphore
        2. supply 2 random ingredients
        3. signals supply semaphore for those 2
        4. posts to supply after a chef finishes 

## Chef Threads - Naive Solution: 
    - each chef waits for the two ingredients they don't have via their semaphores

        *dough chef thread*
        loop: 
            wait sauce
            wait cheese
            make pizza
            post supply

        *sauce chef thread*
        loop: 
            wait dough
            wait cheese
            make pizza
            post supply

        *cheese chef thread*
        loop: 
            wait dough
            wait sauce
            make pizza
            post supply

    Problem: deadlock, starvation?
