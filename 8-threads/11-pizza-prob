**Pizza Makers Problem**

E.g. Cigarette Smokers Problem

Scenario: 
- 3 chef threads and 1 food supplier thread
- chefs loop forever waiting for 3 ingredients, and making pizzas
- ingredients: dough, sauce, cheese
- each chef has an unlimited supply of 1 ingredient
- each time the supplier is signalled it supplies two different random ingredients
- the supplier should only be signalled if no chef can proceed

Setup: 

    semaphores -> supply = 1, dough = 0, sauce = 0, cheese = 0

    Supplier Thread:

    loop:
    1. wait on supply semaphore
    2. supply 2 random ingredients
    3. post supply semaphore

    Naive Solution:

    *dough chef thread*
    loop: 
        wait sauce
        wait cheese
        make pizza
        post supply

    *sauce chef thread*
    loop: 
        wait dough
        wait cheese
        make pizza
        post supply

    *cheese chef thread*
    loop: 
        wait dough
        wait sauce
        make pizza
        post supply

    Problem: deadlock, starvation?
