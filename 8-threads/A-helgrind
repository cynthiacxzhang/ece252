**Helgrind**

Tool for cnocurrent error detection

```bash
valgrind --tool=helgrind ./your_program
```

Detects: 
1. misuse of pthreads API
- e.g. unlocking a mutex you didn't first lock
2. data races
- race conditions, unsafe shared memory accesses
3. lock ordering problems
- deadlocks (potential)
