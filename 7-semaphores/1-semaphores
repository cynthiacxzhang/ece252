**Semaphores**

## Overview

Semaphore: variable used to synchronize processes or threads
- an integer value that cannot go below zero

Note: not a form of IPC similar to the others (pipes, FIFOs, message queues)
- a counter used to provide access to a shared data object for multiple processes

## Example

To obtain a shared resource, a process needs to:

1. test the semaphore that controls the resource
2. if the semaphore is positive, the process can use the resource

    in this case, the process decrements the semaphore value by 1
    - indicates that one unit of the resource is being used

3. if the semaphore is zero, the process must wait until another process releases the resource
4. if the semaphore is negative, the process must wait until another process increments the semaphore to greater than 0

    when the process wakes, it returns to step 1

When a process is done with a shared resource that is controlled by a semaphore, the value is incremented by 1

**System Calls for Semaphores**

1. sem_wait(sem_t *sem)

    decrements the semaphore value by 1
    - if sem was already 0, the call blocks until the sem gets incremented

2. sem_post(sem_t *sem)

    increments the semaphore value by 1
    - if sem was 0, a blocked process (or thread) is unblocked
    - the order of unblocking is undefined

3. sem_init(sem_t *sem, int pshared, unsigned int value)

    pshared: 
        0 for shared between threads (as a global variable or dynamically allocated)
        1 for shared between processes (in a shared memory region)

3. sem_destroy(sem_t *sem)

    destroys a semaphore
    - there should be no blocked processes or threads

All system calls return 0 on success and -1 on error

**Use Cases**

1. Serialization

- e.g. making sure that process 1 precedes process 2

    init sem = 0

    P1: 
        do A
        sem_post(sem) 

    P2:         
        sem_wait(sem)
        do B

2. Mutual Exclusion

- ptoect critical sections of code (e.g. code that zccesses shared data)

    init sem = 1

    P1: 
        sem_wait(sem)
        critical section
        sem_post(sem)

    P2: 
        sem_wait(sem)
        critical section
        sem_post(sem)

- only 1 process can execute their critical section at a time

3. Rendezvous

- both processes must arrive before either continues

    init sem1 = 0
    init sem2 = 0

    P1:
        do A1
        sem_post(sem1)
        sem_wait(sem2)
        do B1

    P2:
        do A2
        sem_post(sem2)
        sem_wait(sem1)
        do B2
    
    synchronize A1 and A2 down the processes

- extend to multiple processes

    needs 1 semaphore per process
    - each process posts to a different semaphore n-1 times
    - each process waits the semaphores of all the other processes (once each)

4. Barrier Synchronization

- a rendezvous for n processes or threads using fewer semaphores

    P1:
        do A1           // sync on this level
        barrier()
        do B1

    P2:
        do A2
        barrier()
        do B2

    ...

    Pn:
        do An
        barrier()
        do Bn

Pseudocode for non-resuable barrier:

    ```c
    int count = 0;
    const int n;
    sem mutex = 1;
    sem turnstile = 0;      // blocks first n-1 processes, when the nth arrives, they take tuyrns letting each other through

    wait mutex
    count++;
    if (count < n):
        post turnstile
    
    post mutex  
    
    wait turnstile // first n-1 block here
    post turnstile // each unblocked process unblocks another
    ```

Final turnstile value = 0 (initial) + 1 post - n waits + n posts = 1
- can't resue this barrier such as:

    ```c
    while (1){
        work();
        barrier();      // will only work the first time
    }```
