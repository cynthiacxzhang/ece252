**POSIX Overview**

IPC: inter-process communication

System V vs POSIX

POSIX: Portable Operating System Interface
- a set of standards for maintaining compatibility between operating systems

Both System V and POSIX IPC: message queues, shared memory, semaphores, and shared file locks
- POSIX IPC is a subset of System V IPC

System V: IPC facilities in almost all Unix systems

Both types of IPC persist in the kernel
- kernel limits the number of IPC resources that can be created at a time
- kernel limits the number of IPC resources that can be shared between processes
