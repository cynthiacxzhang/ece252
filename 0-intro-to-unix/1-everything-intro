**INTRO to UNIX**

OS: software that manages hardware and software resources
- provides services to applications and users
- manages processes, memory, file systems, and I/O devices

Kernel: core part of the OS
- manages system resources and provides essential services

Shell: user interface to the OS
- command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI)

*File IO Overview*

File System in UNIX: arrangment of directories and files
- starts in root (/)

Directory: file that contains directory entries
- each directory entry has filename + file attributes (size, owner, etc)

stat & fstat: system calls used to retrieve information about a file
- stat uses a file path; fstat uses a file descriptor.

Filename: names in a directory      // cannot use (/) or null character
- two filenames auto created when creating a new directory: . and ..

. = current dir
.. = parent dir

In ROOT, . == ..

Pathname: sequence of directory entries leading to a file
- absolute pathname: starts with root (/)
- relative pathname: starts from current directory
