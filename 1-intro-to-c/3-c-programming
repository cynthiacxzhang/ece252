**C Programming Intro**

C is a subset of C++
- C++ is a superset of C, meaning all valid C code is also valid C++ code

C only has structs, no classes

    struct: A user-defined data type that allows grouping of variables of different types
    class: A user-defined data type that allows grouping of variables and functions (methods) of different types

Pass by value only, no pass by reference

    Pass by value: A copy of the variable is passed to the function
    Pass by reference: A reference to the variable is passed to the function, allowing the function to modify the original variable

No function overloading, no exception handling
- C relies on error codes and return values for error handling
