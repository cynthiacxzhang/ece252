**Memory Allocators**

Memory allocators: manage dynamic memory alloc in programs

    malloc() - allocate memory
    free() - deallocate memory
    calloc() - allocate and zero-initialize memory
    realloc() - resize allocated memory

Void pointer: void *
- can be implicitly converted to any other pointer type
- used for generic functions that can handle any data type
- cannot be dereferenced directly - must be cast to a specific pointer type first

Valgrind: tool for detecting memory leaks and errors in C/C++ programs
