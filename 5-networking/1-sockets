**Intro to Networking**

TPC/IP protocol stack: 
- Transport: TCP/UDP
- Presentation: IP
- Session: port number
- Application: application protocol

Sockets: an abstraction of a communication endpoint between two machines
- allows processes to send and receive data over a network

Each socket is identified by: 

    1. IP address: identifies the host
    2. port number: identifies the service/process on that host

IP Addresses: internet protocol, addressing and routing

    1. IPv4: 32 bits
    2. IPv6: 128 bits

DNS: domain name system, maps host names to IP addresses
- a lookup returns the list of IP addresses associated with a hostname

    1. localhost: 127.0.0.1
    2. google.com: 8.8.8.8

- DNS lookup call

    getaddrinfo(hostname, service, hints, result)

    freeaddrinfo(result)
    - frees memory allocated by getaddrinfo()

    - hostname: name of the host to lookup
    - service: name of the service to lookup
    - hints: hints for the lookup
    - result: pointer to the result of the lookup (set to linked list of addresses)

TCP: transmission control protocol, reliable and ordered delivery of data
- end to end connection

Ports: network endpoints on a host (like a phone extension)
- 16 bit numbers
- applications bind to ports
- ports 0 - 1023 are reserved for well-known services
- ports 1024 - 49151 are available registered services
- ports 49152 - 65535 are available for dynamic port allocation

TCP/IP connection: basic TCP workflow

Client Process: 
    1. client creates socket
    2. client connects to server
    3. client sends data to server
    4. server receives data from client
    5. server sends data to client
    6. client receives data from server
    7. client closes socket
    8. server closes socket

Server Process: 

    1. server creates socket
    2. server binds socket to port
    3. server listens for incoming connections
    4. server accepts incoming connections
    5. server sends data to client
    6. client receives data from server
    7. client sends data to server
    8. server receives data from client
    9. server closes socket
    10. client closes socket

## System Calls for Sockets

1. socket(int domain, int type, int protocol)       // both client and server

    - domain: protocol family
    - type: socket type
    - protocol: protocol number

    socket() returns a socket file descriptor, -1 on error

2. bind(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen)   //server

    - sockfd: socket file descriptor
    - addr: address to bind to (socket address)
    - addrlen: length of address

    bind() returns 0 on success and -1 on error

3. listen(int sockfd, int backlog)  // server

    - sockfd: socket file descriptor
    - backlog: maximum number of pending connections

    listen() returns 0 on success and -1 on error

4. accept(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t *addrlen)    // server

    - sockfd: socket file descriptor
    - addr: address to bind to (socket address)
    - addrlen: length of address

    accept() returns a new socket file descriptor for the connection

5. connect(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen)  //client

    - sockfd: socket file descriptor
    - addr: address to bind to (socket address)
    - addrlen: length of address

    connect() returns 0 on success and -1 on error

6. send(int sockfd, const void *buf, size_t len, int flags) // ssize_t

    - sockfd: socket file descriptor
    - buf: buffer to send
    - len: length of buffer
    - flags: flags

    send() returns the number of bytes sent, -1 on error
    - can send arbitrarily large data

7. recv(int sockfd, void *buf, size_t len, int flags)   // ssize_t

    - sockfd: socket file descriptor
    - buf: buffer to receive
    - len: length of buffer
    - flags: flags

    recv() returns the number of bytes received
    - data may be deceived in multiple segments

8. close(int sockfd)

    - sockfd: socket file descriptor    

## Byte Order

- big endian: most significant byte first
- little endian: least significant byte first

Given: 0x12345678

    big endian: 0x78 0x56 0x34 0x12

    little endian: 0x12 0x34 0x56 0x78

- big endian: network byte order
- little endian: host byte order

- network byte order: order of bytes used for network communication
- host byte order: order of bytes used for host operation

## Endian Conversion

Always convert multibyte ints to/from network byte order

Longs: 4 bytes, 32 bits
- htonl(): convert host byte order to network byte order
- ntohl(): convert network byte order to host byte order

Shorts: 2 bytes, 16 bits
- htons(): convert host byte order to network byte order
- ntohs(): convert network byte order to host byte order
