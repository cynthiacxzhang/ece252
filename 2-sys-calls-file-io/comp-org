PART 1: COMPUTER organization

Computer organization refers to the operational structure and components of a computer system. Here’s a simplified explanation from the system bus to general purpose registers:

1. **System Bus**:  
    The system bus is a communication pathway that connects the major components of a computer. It typically consists of three main types:
    - **Data Bus**: Transfers actual data.
    - **Address Bus**: Carries memory addresses.
    - **Control Bus**: Sends control signals (read/write, interrupt, etc.).

2. **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**:  
    The CPU is the brain of the computer, connected to the system bus. It executes instructions and processes data.

3. **Memory (RAM/ROM)**:  
    Connected to the system bus, memory stores data and instructions for the CPU.

4. **I/O Devices**:  
    Input/Output devices (like keyboards, disks, network cards) communicate with the CPU and memory via the system bus.

5. **Registers**:  
    Inside the CPU, registers are small, fast storage locations. They temporarily hold data, instructions, and addresses.

6. **General Purpose Registers**:  
    These are a subset of CPU registers used for arithmetic, logic operations, and data manipulation. Examples include AX, BX, CX, DX in x86 architecture.

**Summary Flow:**  
System Bus ↔ CPU (with Registers) ↔ Memory  ↔ Timer  ↔ IO ↔ HDD
