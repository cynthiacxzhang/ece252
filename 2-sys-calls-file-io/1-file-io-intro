**INTRO to File IO**

File System in UNIX: arrangment of directories and files
- starts in root (/)

Directory: file that contains directory entries
- each directory entry has filename + file attributes (size, owner, etc)

stat & fstat: system calls used to retrieve information about a file
- stat uses a file path; fstat uses a file descriptor.

Filename: names in a directory      // cannot use (/) or null character
- two filenames auto created when creating a new directory: . and ..

. = current dir
.. = parent dir

In ROOT, . == ..

Pathname
