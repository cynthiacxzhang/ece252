**File Permissions**

A file permissions code such as 0644 is interpreted as follows:

* The first digit, 0, specifies the special permissions. In this case, there are no special permissions.
* The second digit, 6, specifies the owner's permissions: read (4), write (2), and execute (1) permissions, which in octal is 6.
* The third digit, 4, specifies the group's permissions: read (4) permission, which in octal is 4.
* The fourth digit, 4, specifies the permissions for others: read (4) permission, which in octal is 4.

So, in this case, the file owner has read and write permissions, and the group and others have read-only permissions.
