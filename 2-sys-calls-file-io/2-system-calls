**System Calls Overview**

User code request for OS service via trap instructions

thread of execution:
1. stores operands in registers
2. invokes trap instruction
3. kernel reads operands from registers and performs system calls

Read File: 

    ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);

    - fd: file descriptor (an integer representing an open file)
    - buf: pointer to a buffer where the read data will be stored
    - count: maximum number of bytes to read

    returns: 1. # of bytes read 
             2. 0 if end of file (EOF) is reached
             3. -1 on error (errno is set)

**Universality of IO**

Concept: in operating systems, all I/O devices are handled using the same system call interface

    open()
    close()
    read()
    write()

- this abstraction allows the OS to treat all devices uniformly, simplifying the programming model

    network sockets
    pipes
    terminals
    etc
