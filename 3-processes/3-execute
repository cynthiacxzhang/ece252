**Execute**

Execute: the exec family of functions is used to execute a new program, replacing the current process with a new one

exec() -> replaces current process image with a new program image

    system call: execve(const char *pathname, char *const argv[], char *const envp[])

    library call: #include <unistd.h>
                  exec{l, v}[p][e]()

                  {l, v} = list of arguments, vector of arguments
                  p = use path to find the executable
                  e = use environment variables

    variations: execl, execv, execle, execve, execvp
    - all wrappers for the execve system call
    - a wrapper is a function that calls another function with some additional functionality

    execve only returns -1 if there is an error
